# miabis-mapper
Software to map biobank data model to MIABIS 2.0. Map the local data model against MIABIS model interactively and get the results in JSON.
Demo available at http://bbmri-biobank.meb.ki.se/
We have put together some example test files under the directory "test files" which can be mapped against the MIABIS model. If you want 
to map your files, you have to create similar files for each entity. Each entity file will then contain its attributes separated by comma.
You then load these files in the browser and map the attributes against the standard.
